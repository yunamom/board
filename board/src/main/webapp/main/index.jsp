    <h2>JavaServer Pages (JSP)</h2>
    <p>JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a Java standard technology that enables you to write dynamic,
    data-driven pages for your Java web applications. JSP is built on top of the Java Servlet specification.
    The two technologies typically work together, especially in older Java web applications.
    From a coding perspective,the most obvious difference between them is that with servlets you write Java code and then embed client-side markup (like HTML) into that code,
    whereas with JSP you start with the client-side script or markup, then embed JSP tags to connect your page to the Java backend.</p>
